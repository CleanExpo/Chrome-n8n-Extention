                    Workflow Engine
```

### Key Components
1. **Input Handlers**: Accept user input in various formats
2. **AI Model Nodes**: Process data through AI models
3. **Logic Controllers**: Handle conditional logic and branching
4. **Output Formatters**: Format and present results
5. **Tool Integrations**: Connect external tools and APIs

## 🔧 How It Works

### Step 1: Define Your Goal
- Describe what you want your app to do
- Use natural language or visual builder
- Opal understands and creates initial workflow

### Step 2: Build the Workflow
