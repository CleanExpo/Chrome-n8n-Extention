# Add this to your system PATH:
C:\Users\Disaster Recovery 4\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python311\Scripts
```

### 2. Tesseract OCR (Optional Enhancement)
For enhanced OCR capabilities, you can install Tesseract:
- Download from: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract
- Add to PATH after installation
- **Note**: Basic OCR will work without this, but full OCR features need it

## üöÄ **Your System is READY!**

You can now test your automation capabilities:

```javascript
// These should work immediately:
