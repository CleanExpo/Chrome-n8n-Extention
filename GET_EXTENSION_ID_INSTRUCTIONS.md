# Chrome Extension ID Instructions

## Step 1: Get Your Extension ID

1. Open Chrome and navigate to: `chrome://extensions`
2. Make sure "Developer mode" is enabled (toggle in top-right)
3. Find your "n8n AI Assistant" extension in the list
4. Copy the Extension ID (it looks like: `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdef`)

## Step 2: Update Native Host Manifest

Once you have your Extension ID, I'll help you update the `native-host/manifest.json` file.

## Step 3: Register Native Host

After updating the manifest, we'll run the Windows Registry command to register the native host with Chrome.
