# 🚀 Native Host Testing Guide

## ✅ Setup Complete!

Your Chrome extension native host is now fully configured and ready for testing!

### What's Been Installed:
- ✅ All Python automation libraries (PyAutoGUI, OpenCV, etc.)
- ✅ Extension ID updated in manifest.json
- ✅ Native host registered with Chrome Registry
- ✅ System automation capabilities enabled

## 🧪 Test Your System Control

### Step 1: Basic System Tests

Open your Chrome extension and try these commands in the browser console:

```javascript
// Test 1: Take a screenshot
unifiedAssistant.execute("take screenshot")

// Test 2: Launch Notepad
unifiedAssistant.execute("launch notepad")

// Test 3: Type text (make sure Notepad is focused)
unifiedAssistant.execute("type Hello World from AI!")
```

### Step 2: Advanced Automation Tests

```javascript
// Test 4: Get system information
unifiedAssistant.execute("get system info")

// Test 5: Window management
unifiedAssistant.execute("list windows")
unifiedAssistant.execute("focus Calculator")

// Test 6: Mouse control
unifiedAssistant.execute("move mouse to 500,300")
unifiedAssistant.execute("click at 500,300")
```

### Step 3: Power User Examples

```javascript
// Daily Standup Automation
unifiedAssistant.execute("prepare daily standup")
// → Opens Jira, Git, Slack
// → Extracts yesterday's work  
// → Drafts standup message

// Research Automation
unifiedAssistant.execute("research quantum computing and create report")
// → Opens multiple sources
// → Extracts key information
// → Creates formatted report
// → Saves to your notes

// Development Automation  
unifiedAssistant.execute("setup new React project with our stack")
// → Creates folders
// → Installs dependencies
// → Configures tools
// → Opens in VS Code
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If commands don't work:

1. **Check Extension**: Make sure your extension is loaded and active
2. **Restart Chrome**: Close and reopen Chrome completely
3. **Check Console**: Open Developer Tools → Console for error messages
4. **Verify Registry**: The native host should be registered at:
   `HKCU\Software\Google\Chrome\NativeMessagingHosts\com.n8n.assistant`
