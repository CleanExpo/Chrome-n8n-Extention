# üîÑ How to See the Latest Models - Step by Step

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: The extension needs to be reloaded to see updates!

## Step 1: Completely Remove Old Extension
1. Open Chrome
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Find ALL versions of "Private AI Assistant" or "AI Assistant"
4. Click "Remove" on each one
5. **Close Chrome completely** (all windows)

## Step 2: Clear Chrome Cache (Optional but recommended)

3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Navigate to `D:\Chrome Extention n8n`
5. Click "Select Folder"

## Step 4: Verify It Loaded Correctly
Look at the extension card. You should see:
- **Service Worker**: `background-latest-models.js` (should say "Active")
- **Inspect views**: service worker (should be clickable)

### Click on "service worker" to open console
You should see messages like:
```
üöÄ Background script with latest models starting...
Settings loaded: {selectedModel: "gpt-4o-mini", ...}
‚úÖ Enhanced background script with latest models loaded!
```

## Step 5: Check the Popup
1. Click the extension icon in Chrome toolbar
2. Look for the **dropdown menu in the header** (between "AI Assistant" and "Ready")
3. Click the dropdown - you should see:
   - **OpenAI section**: GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini, o1 Preview, o1 Mini, etc.
   - **Google section**: Gemini 2.0, Gemini 1.5 Pro, etc.
   - **Anthropic section**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Haiku, etc.

1. Click the extension icon
2. Click the ‚öôÔ∏è (settings) button at bottom
3. In the left sidebar, look for "üß† AI Models" option
4. Click it to see model configuration page

## Step 7: Test the Models
Open this test page in a new tab:
```
file:///D:/Chrome%20Extention%20n8n/test-models.html
```

You should see:
- OpenAI Models section with GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini, o1 models
- Google Gemini Models with Gemini 2.0 Flash
- Anthropic Claude Models with Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Haiku

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If you DON'T see the model dropdown:

**Check 1**: Is the right script loaded?
- Go to chrome://extensions/
- Look at your extension
- Under "Inspect views", it should say `service worker (background-latest-models.js)`
- If it says `background-working.js` or something else, the old version is cached

**Check 2**: Force reload
- On chrome://extensions/
- Click the refresh button (‚Üª) on the extension card
- Hold Shift and click it again

**Check 3**: Check popup file
- The popup should be using `popup/popup-simple.html`
- Check if the dropdown appears in the header area

### If models don't appear in dropdown:

**Check Console**:
1. Right-click extension icon
2. Select "Inspect popup"
3. Go to Console tab
4. Look for errors

**Common Issues**:
- Old popup cached: Clear cache and reload
- Storage not synced: Open settings, save, then reload

### Still Not Working?

**Nuclear Option - Complete Reset**:
1. Delete the extension from Chrome
2. Delete these files from the folder:
   - Any `.cache` files
   - Any `node_modules` folder
3. Open Command Prompt as Administrator
4. Run: `ipconfig /flushdns`
5. Restart Chrome
6. Load extension fresh

## ‚úÖ What You Should See When Working:

1. **In Popup Header**: Dropdown showing "GPT-4o Mini" or other model
2. **In Dropdown Menu**: Three sections (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic)
3. **In Settings Sidebar**: "üß† AI Models" option
4. **In Test Page**: All latest models listed with Test buttons
5. **In Console**: Messages about "latest models" loaded

## üìù Quick Test
Once loaded, in the popup:
1. Click the model dropdown
2. Select "GPT-4o"
3. Type "What model are you?"
4. It should respond mentioning GPT-4o

Then try:
1. Select "Claude 3.5 Sonnet"
2. Type "What model are you?"
3. It should mention Claude (if you have Anthropic API key)
